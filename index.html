  <p>I’m a data scientist and ML engineer — and when the problem calls for it, a hands-on data engineer. I’m currently the Data Manager at the Next Generation Cities Institute (Concordia University), where I lead data science and data engineering efforts aligned with our mission to enable smart cities and smart buildings. Day to day, that means turning messy sensor streams and complex physical systems into models that forecast, control, and optimize — and making sure those models actually run in the real world.</p>

  <p>My path started in mechanical engineering, with deep work in fluid dynamics and turbulence. That foundation gave me a strong command of applied mathematics and a “dynamical systems” way of thinking. I’m comfortable living at the interface of signals, models, and control: data-driven modeling, physics-informed learning, and data-driven control are where I do my best work. I care about interpretability and first-principles reasoning, and I like to pair them with modern ML when it moves the needle.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p>I’m also very practical. I design and operate end-to-end data flows for sensor-rich environments — from ingestion and metadata/ontology design through storage, governance, and APIs — and I deploy models so they’re observable, reliable, and, when needed, edge-friendly. I’ve helped stand up building-scale IoT pipelines, digital-twin style workflows, and control systems that are measurable in their impact, not just interesting on paper.</p>

  <p>At heart, I’m a researcher who builds: curious, experimental, and unafraid to learn new tools or borrow ideas across disciplines. My portfolio spans hybrid physics/ML for HVAC optimization (including sparse system identification and model-based RL), reduced-order modeling for spatiotemporal fields, LLM/RAG pipelines for evidence extraction in long technical documents, and city-scale geospatial inference. The common thread is bridging mathematical intuition with practical, data-driven solutions that ship.</p>

  <p>I’m a team player who’s happy to fill the gaps — scoping with stakeholders, prototyping fast, validating with the right math, documenting clearly, and helping others get unblocked. I’m open to roles titled Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or Applied Researcher, especially where digital twins, control, and IoT analytics come together to improve how buildings and cities operate.</p>
